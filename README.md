# Habit
Make "being in the moment" a habit of yours.

## Conceptualization
Given all this extra time thanks to the quarantine, I was inspired to learn about developing iOS apps.
So why not try and create a social network? What would make a fun social network? 
What if we took the concept of Snapchat/Instagram stories, and made it so you **have** to and can **only** post once a day,
and if you don't, your account gets deleted.
